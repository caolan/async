 * @param {Array|Object} coll - A collection to iterate over.
 * @param {Function} iteratee - A function to apply to each item in `coll`. The
 * `key` is the item's key, or index in the case of an array. The iteratee is
 * passed a `callback(err)` which must be called once it has completed. If no
 * error has occurred, the callback should be run without arguments or with an
 * explicit `null` argument. Invoked with (item, key, callback).
 * @param {Function} [callback] - A callback which is called when all `iteratee`
 * functions have finished, or an error occurs. Invoked with (err).
