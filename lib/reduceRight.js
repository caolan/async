 * array to produce the next step in the reduction. The `iteratee` is passed a
 * `callback(err, reduction)` which accepts an optional error as its first
 * argument, and the state of the reduction as the second. If an error is
 * passed to the callback, the reduction is stopped and the main `callback` is
 * immediately called with the error. Invoked with (memo, item, callback).
 * @param {Function} [callback] - A callback which is called after all the
 * `iteratee` functions have finished. Result is the reduced value. Invoked with
