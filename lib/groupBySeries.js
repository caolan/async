 * @param {number} limit - The maximum number of async operations at a time.
 * @param {Function} iteratee - A function to apply to each item in `coll`.
 * The iteratee is passed a `callback(err, key)` which must be called once it
 * has completed with an error (which can be `null`) and the `key` to group the
 * value under. Invoked with (value, callback).
 * @param {Function} [callback] - A callback which is called when all `iteratee`
 * functions have finished, or an error occurs. Result is an `Object` whoses
 * properties are arrays of values which returned the corresponding key.
