 * completed with an optional `err` argument. Invoked with (callback).
 * @param {Function} test - synchronous truth test to perform after each
 * execution of `fn`. Invoked with the non-error callback results of `fn`.
 * @param {Function} [callback] - A callback which is called after the test
 * function has passed and repeated execution of `fn` has stopped. `callback`
 * will be passed an error and any arguments passed to the final `fn`'s
 * callback. Invoked with (err, [results]);
