/**
 * ```
 * import mapValues from 'async/mapValues'
 * ```
 * A relative of [`map`]{@link module:Collections.map}, designed for use with objects.
 *
 * Produces a new Object by mapping each value of `obj` through the `iteratee`
 * function. The `iteratee` is called each `value` and `key` from `obj` and a
 * callback for when it has finished processing. Each of these callbacks takes
 * two arguments: an `error`, and the transformed item from `obj`. If `iteratee`
 * passes an error to its callback, the main `callback` (for the `mapValues`
 * function) is immediately called with the error.
 *
 * Note, the order of the keys in the result is not guaranteed.  The keys will
 * be roughly in the order they complete, (but this is very engine-specific)
 *
 * @name mapValues
 * @static
 * @memberOf module:Collections
 * @method
 * @category Collection
 * @param {Object} obj - A collection to iterate over.
 * @param {Function} iteratee - A function to apply to each value and key in
 * `coll`. The iteratee is passed a `callback(err, transformed)` which must be
 * called once it has completed with an error (which can be `null`) and a
 * transformed value. Invoked with (value, key, callback).
 * @param {Function} [callback] - A callback which is called when all `iteratee`
 * functions have finished, or an error occurs. Results is an array of the
 * transformed items from the `obj`. Invoked with (err, result).
 * @example
 *
 * async.mapValues({
 *     f1: 'file1',
 *     f2: 'file2',
 *     f3: 'file3'
 * }, fs.stat, function(err, result) {
 *     // results is now a map of stats for each file, e.g.
 *     // {
 *     //     f1: [stats for file1],
 *     //     f2: [stats for file2],
 *     //     f3: [stats for file3]
 *     // }
 * });
