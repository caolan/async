Note, this alone is not what will make HAL asynchronous. This repo mostly relates to 
responsive web design.

Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions for working with asynchronous JavaScript. 
Although originally designed for use with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and installable via `npm install --save async`, it 
can also be used directly in the browser.
